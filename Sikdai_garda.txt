        Day 1 - Intro to HTML and elements 

Day - 1
goal-to get introduced to html and its elements

World Wide Web created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 while at CERN

HTML - hyper text markup language 
    A markup language is a text-encoding system which specifies the structure and formatting of a document and potentially the relationship between its parts.
    Interestingly markdown language is also a markup language
    John Gruber daju thought markup tah markup tara is downright simplified, so lets call it markdown .

    so markup - syntatically formatting,structure,realtion establish garne
    markdown - same same but more streamlined
    Example - <b> BOLD ITEM <b>    ||    #Bold Item 

    What is XML then ? XML vs HTML 
    HTML - Hyper Text Markup Language (1993 - Tim Berners-lee)
        Hypertext (link between web pages) &&  Markup (format|define|doc manipulation)  
        Presentation Language
    XML - Extensible Markup Language (1996)
        Store and transport data
        Data describing custom tags
    Major diff being - html is a markup language && XML provides a framework to define markup languages

HTML elements are basically labels 
    yo chai paragraph ho hai
    yo chai header...

Understanding a simple boilerplate
    --- 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
        <title>Document</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        
    </body>
    </html>
    ---

    <!Doctype html>
        declares the doc type and version of html
        tells the browser that doc is html5
    <html lang="en">
        useful for accessibility and search engine
        specifies the language of doc's content
    <head>
        Contains meta-information about the document.
        where you include metadata (data about data), 
        links to stylesheets, scripts, and 
        other resources that are not directly visible on the page.

        <meta charset="UTF-8">
            UTF - Unicode Transformation Format
            8 bit code units - each char can be of multiple of 8 bits
            UTF-8 - character encoding that covers almost all characters and symbols in the world. 
            ensures that the text content is displayed correctly.

        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
            controls the layout on mobile browsers
            viewport - essential for responsive web design
            width = device-width sets the width of page to follow the screen width

        title - sets title which seen on title bar or tab
        body
            contains the content of html doc
            text,images,links

HTML Element
    <tagname> Content </tagname>
    The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag (interesting | I thought tag matrai ho :(   )
    some elements have no content - <br>
        called empty elements
        they have no end tag
    
Browsers determine how to display the document based on the tags | based on content inside <body>

Html docs have extension .html or html ,and can be written on any text editors



<!doctype>  - only once at top of page - not case sensitive
    The <!DOCTYPE> declaration for HTML5 is: <!DOCTYPE html>
    HTML 3.2 was an earlier version of HTML  - <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2 Final//EN">

<h1> to <h6>
    header tags
    size | priority - h1 > h2 > h3 .....
    <h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<p> 
    Paragraph
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
<a>
    links
    link destination specified by 'href' attribute
    <a href="www.google.com">This is a link</a>
<img>
    image
    <img src="google.jpeg" alt="google ho yo" width="104" height="142">
    'src' - source file
    'alt' - alternative text (accessibility)
    'width' && 'height' - size


Html elements can be nested
    elements can contain other elements
    <body>
        <br>
    </body>

HTML is not strict as XML so forgetting an end tag is not the end of the world
    but expected behaviour might not be achieved
HTML is also not case sensitive
    <P> === <p>
    but good practice is lower re .... also html is not a programming language if you already haven't got it yet.


Lets wrap up for today, we'll continue with attributes tomorrow

    Element Structure: Start and end tags, content, and empty elements.
    HTML Syntax: Case-insensitivity, file extensions, and nesting elements.

I am using VScode to document and edit my leanring and html doc editing 
Liveserver extension is used for seamless auto update while simultaneously editing the html docs

Problem 
    Simple html document
    no auto boilerplate - memory bata lekhne
    title - 'mero pailo html'
    use learnt elemets appropriately 
---path---      webtechnology-shailesh-bas\Lab1\HTMLS\Day1.html
Interestingly
    if html tag ma sab kura enclose nagare simple text bhanera mando raixa browserle
    <! –– and the comment closes with ––>  (to comment)
    <a href="#"><h1>class ma chai napadhi k garxa kto</h1></a>
        so i had used h1 to enclose the text inside 'a' tag  - valid but not recommended 
        <h1><a href="#">class ma chai napadhi k garxa kto</a></h1>
            is a better approach but as h1 also sets it to highest priority maybe not the right decision :(
